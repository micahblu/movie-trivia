# Movie Trivia

This is my first react application. It uses themoviedb.org api to create a fun 2 player movie trivia quiz game.

## Getting started
 Obtain an api key from themoviedb.org you can get more info here: https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api 
 
 Create a file `src/api-key.js` with the following:
 ```js
export default {
  key: 'insert api key here'
}
 ```

run `npm run build`

Currently there is no localhost server, so you'll need to open the index.html directly with a browser.
